(* This is the fundamental piece of evidence in the refinement logic.
 * We have one way of forming a derivation for each rule in our PRL
 * and we'll create derivations each time we construct a proof in our logic.
 * More over, each derivation can be "extracted" into a computational
 * realizer.
 *
 * Unforunately, derivations all have a binding structure which means more
 * De Bruijn indices.

signature DERIVATION =

  (* I've annotated each derivation with the rule I intend it
   * to represent for motivation, this will be mechanized later
   * in the refiner by a tactic in rules/.
   *
   * The peculiar notation of H >> ... should be understood
   * as \Gamma \vdash in many ways but looks significantly better
   * in ASCII :)
   *
   * IMPORTANT: Derivations in here contain terms (for things like application)
   * we silently allow to point to binding sites. Note that most occurences
   * of ints specify universe levels (i in U(i))
